#RepPro JS Coding Challenges

These are some basic (and advanced) coding challenges

Here's the basic workflow:

```bash
$ npm install
$ cd (debounce)
$ vi index.js
$ npm test
```
This uses a basic TDD approach so take a look at the test.js file in each directory to see what needs to be implemented, write an index.js as the solution file
